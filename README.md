# LShaped.jl

The L-Shaped Algorithm is used in many applications of two-stage stochastic
optimization problems. This version is presented in Introduction to Stochastic
Programming by Birge, Louveaux. The current implementation also assumes perfect
feasibility of both the first and second stage problems. As such, users are
cautioned to structure models in this way. This implementation is still in
development so expect frequent updates to this package.
