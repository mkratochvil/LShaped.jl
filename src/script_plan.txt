*** Setup parameters ***

There should be a file structure that includes anything that needs to be built in (e.g. functions to build the model). 
Outside of julia can be stored within the job submission/bash script. Inside of julia should be stored as a csv or other external file.

** Outside of julia **

* Max Iterations
* Number of subproblems
* info file name/location
* (more potentially)


** Inside of julia **

* file name (to be saved at)
* first stage model constructor script .jl file location.
* second stage model constructor script .jl file location.
* solver (e.g. Gurobi)


*** First Stage to/from file notes ***

-Check if file exists.
	+If not, create.
	-If so:
		-Update E, e, and w from second stage stuff
		-Check for convergence by comparing w, theta in last line of file.
			-if convergence
				-quit
			-else
				-continue

+Load in first stage vdict and model (not second stage!!)

+Create firststage struct


# figure out how to do this with current file structure.
# do NOT need second stage stuff.
-Solve model for new x.

Save x to file.


*** Second stage to/from file notes ***

Check if file exits.
	If not
		terminate. file structure needs to be made in first stage.
	If so, grab x and use it to build model.

Build subproblem based on environmental variable arrayid (this will be built in while prototyping outside of cluster).
